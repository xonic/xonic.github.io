        Responsive Web Design is what I'm <strong>really good at</strong>. I've helped companies large and small design and develop their websites and web applications so that they look amazing and work perfectly on any given device. Whether it's a touch or keyboard device, small or big screen. You name it.

      <p>
        Well, actually not such a long way but still: I studied <strong>Media Informatics</strong>, mainly focused on Design and Human Computer Interaction at the Technical University of Vienna, Austria. During the last 4 years I worked as a <strong>User Experience Designer</strong> over at <a href="http://intuio.at" title="Visit their page">intuio</a>, a small but truly great UX company with highly talented people. Besides designing awesome things at intuio I also designed <a href="/work/" title="Show some work">some awesome things</a> on my own.
