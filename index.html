  <h1 class="tagline">Hi, I'm Tom&nbsp;:)</h1>
  <h2 class="subtagline">A passionate Interaction Designer and Front-End Developer based in Berlin.</h2>

  <p>
    Responsive Web Design is what I'm <strong>really good at</strong>. I've helped companies large and small design and develop their websites and web applications so that they look amazing and work perfectly on any given device. Whether it's a touch or keyboard device, small or big screen. You name it.

  <h1 class="subtagline">I've come a long way, baby.</h1>

  <p>
    Well, actually not such a long way but still: I studied Media Informatics mainly focused on Design and Human Computer Interaction at the Technical University of Vienna, Austria. During the last 4 years I worked as a User Experience Designer over at <a href="http://intuio.at" title="Visit their page">intuio</a>, a small but truly great UX company with highly talented people. Besides designing awesome things at intuio I also designed <a href="/work/" title="Show some work">some awesome things</a> on my own.

    In this new era of web design I quit design by drawing pictures and begun to design almost completely inside the browser. I firmly believe in the mobile first approach but find it important not to overlook large screens in early project phases. Also, if you ask me, I'd say websites should be accessible and progressively enhanced to ensure basic functionality for all users and delightful experiences for those using cutting edge browsers.
