    <h1>My design process</h1>
    <p>Designing is all about diverging and converging. First we discover as much as possible about our users and their contexts through research, then we define and prioritise problems and opportunities, next we explore and ideate many different solutions and finally we reduce ideas to the one's that really work.</p>

    <p>This is called the double diamond approach. It splits the design process into four phases: discover, define, develop, deliver. After the fourth phase the final deliverables should be handed over to the development team to implement the product. This is the design approach I follow but it is only the start.</p>

    <p>As a UX designer I consider it my responsibility to go the extra mile and support implementation and test the final product once live. From my experience I know that unforeseen circumstances or technical obstacles will rise during implementation and UX relevant decisions need to be taken. Once the product is live it should be mandatory to test and validate the final outcome again.</p>

    <p>If everything is fine and the product is good to go it is time to think about ways and channels to constantly get qualitative feedback from users and augment the quantitative data that is collected automatically.</p>

<section class="discover">
    <h2>Discover</h2>

    </div>
    <h3>I help understanding</h3>
    <p>The first phase is about researching user and business needs. Data is key: quantitative data shows <strong>what</strong> is happening and qualitative data reveals <strong>why</strong> it is happening. By analysing quantitative data, interviewing and observing users (and internal stakeholders), creating personas, mapping processes and experiences I help to make sure we fully understand the problem before we start to think about solutions.</p>

<section class="define">
    <h2>Define</h2>

        <img alt="Value proposition canvas" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2--process--define.jpg">
    </div>
    <h3>I help prioritising</h3>
    <p>Our next goal is to frame the problem we want to tackle. The Personas, experience maps I created and the user's jobs, pains, gains I discovered will enable us to prioritise and define product opportunities we see. The outcome is a set of hypotheses about how we might create something valuable and impactful for our users as well as for the business.</p>

<section class="develop">
    <h2>Develop</h2>
    <div class="pic">
        <img alt="Post-its on a wall" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2--process--design--workshop-3.jpg">
    </div>
    <h3>I help exploring</h3>
    During this phase—my favourite by the way—I facilitate collaborative design workshops with stakeholders and/or users. Making use of everyone's creativity results in better concepts and it fosters an inclusive team setup where everyone can participate and contribute. With everyone's input gathered I begin to sketch, wireframe, prototype and test refined concepts of the product. This is a very iterative process and prototypes I build range from paper to actual code (HTML/CSS/JS).

<section class="deliver">
    <h2>Deliver</h2>
    <div class="section__wrapper">

        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>I help getting it done</h3>
            <p>When we know what we should build, I develop the product's personality by setting the tone of voice, handpicking beautiful typefaces and crafting a matching color palette. I refine animation of UI elements and deliver high-end mockups. If needed I can build and implement a whole pattern library that developers can use to build the final product.</p>

<section class="verify">
    <h2>Verify</h2>
    <div class="pic">
        <img alt="User testing" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2--process--verify-2.jpg">
    </div>
    <h3>I go the extra mile</h3>
    Delivering the product is not enough. When others consider their work done, I go the extra mile and validate the live application with actual users to make sure we actually met the goals we set. Evaluating quantitative and qualitative data again after launch will help us further improve the product and bring it to the next level.
